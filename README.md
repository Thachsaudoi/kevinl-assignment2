# kevinl-assignment2 User Workflow

In the user workflow of the kevinl-assignment2 web app, the following steps are involved:

## 1. Launching the App
When the user enters the app, they will be greeted with the initial screen. The app's interface should provide clear navigation options for the user to perform various actions.

## 2. Adding a New User
The user has the option to add a new user to the app. By selecting the "Add User" feature, a form will be presented where the user can input the required details. It is important to validate the user inputs to ensure they are correct and complete. The app should provide appropriate error messages or warnings if any invalid or missing information is detected. For a better user interface (UI) experience, it is recommended to display the weight and height above 100, as it creates a nicer look.

## 3. Viewing Current Users
The app allows the user to view the list of current users. By selecting the "View Users" option, the user can access a page where all the users are displayed. The user information should be presented in accordance with the assignment requirements. The display should be user-friendly and easy to comprehend.

## 4. Adding More Users
After viewing the current users, the user has the option to add more users by selecting the "Add User" button. Clicking this button should navigate the user back to the form for adding a new user.

## 5. Editing a Specific User
The app provides functionality for editing specific user details. Within the "View Users" page, each user entry should have an "Edit" button. When the user clicks the "Edit" button for a particular user, they should be redirected to a form pre-populated with the existing user's information. The user can make necessary changes to the user's details and save the modifications.

## 6. Deleting a User
The app allows the deletion of a specific user from the system. Within the "View Users" page, each user entry should have a "Delete" button. Clicking the "Delete" button should prompt the user to confirm the deletion.

## 7. GPA Validation
There is a specific validation rule for the GPA field. The GPA value must fall within the range of 0 to 4.33. If the user enters a value outside this range, a warning message or error prompt should appear, notifying the user about the invalid input.

It is essential to ensure a smooth and intuitive user experience throughout the web app. Implementing appropriate feedback messages, clear navigation, and efficient validation will contribute to a positive user interaction with the application.
